# ViaVersionAutoUpdate
Auto updates the ViaVersion plugin on your Bukkit or Bungeecord server

## Usage
Simply put this plugin in your plugins folder and it will automatically update your ViaVersion plugin whenever a new update is avaliable.

When a new update is downloaded, the server will display a 5 minute countdown before restarting itself to install the new update. On spigot servers, the server is restarted with the /restart command, on others, the server is shutdown and you will be expected to turn the server back on (manually or automatically).
